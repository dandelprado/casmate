medical microbiology prerequisite?
is there a prereq for subjects

# Issue 

is there a prereq for medical microbiology? 

- it gave incorrect answer. it detected microbiology, instead of the medical microbiology.

2. is there a prereq for fundamentals of discrete structures?
I found a few courses with similar names. Could you type the specific course code or full title you need? Here are the ones I see:
• CS 121 — Fundamentals of Discrete Structures
• CC 131 — Advanced Discrete Structures

- gave the following answer despite being clear about the subject needed.

3. is discrete structure in the curriculum?
I'm not quite sure which program you mean.

Some examples I can help with are BS Computer Science, BS Psychology, or BA Communication.

Which program are you interested in?

I think, this should be answered with the multiple course fallback. Since there is fundamentals of discrete and advanced discrete structures

4. BS Computer science
I found MATH 212 — Calculus for Computer Science.

What do you need? I can check its units, prerequisites, or verify if it's in your curriculum. 

5. BS Psychology

I found a few courses with similar names. Could you type the specific course code or full title you need? Here are the ones I see:
• PSYCH 101 — Introduction to Psychology
• PSYCH 112 — Social Psychology
• PSYCH 108 — Abnormal Psychology
• PSYCH 113 — Cognitive Psychology
• PSYCH 105 L/L — Experimental Psychology
• PSYCH 104 — Developmental Psychology
